There are other plotting libraries, but `matplotlib` was designed to mimic much of the functionality of Matlab plotting and is thus very nice for those of us who transitioned from Matlab to python.\n",

We note that there are other powerful image libraries, including `PIL` / `pillow` which is used by the very nice `pandas` library for data manipulation.  We work with images as simple `nparrays` here since that best illustrates the basic image processing concepts.\n",

    "## 1.3 Changing display parameters\n",
    "There are various choices in display that you can make, including:\n",
    "  - scaling the figure window using `figsize=(x,y)` within the `plt.figure()` command.  In this, `x` and `y` are in units of inches by default. The concept of measuring the image in inches comes from printing standards, and doesn't apply very intuitively to computer graphics. An image that is defined as a given size in inches may render as larger on one screen and smaller on another since different screens have different resolutions. When the user specifies the dimensions of an image in inches, these dimensions are converted from inches to pixels. By default, matplotlib uses 72 pixels per square inch, though this value can be modified by the user. A reasonable choice for these values will depend on your computer's resolution and screen size. More information on figure size units can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/figure_size_units.html).\n",
    "  - scaling the size of the text labels with the command `plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': f})` where `f` is the font size you desire in units of pt, e.g., 20.  You need to run this only once to update the font size parameters, after which all subsequent figure windows will use this new font size. The \"rc\" in \"rcParams\" stands for runtime configuration, and the rcParams variable stores configuration variables in a dictionary-like datatype. You can find more information about runtime configurations for matplotlib [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#customizing-with-dynamic-rc-settings).\n",
    "  - removing all axis decorators (including ticks, tick labels, axis labels, etc.) with the command `plt.axis('off')`\n",
    "  - adding axis labels or a title to your plot, e.g., `plt.xlabel('flamingos')`, `plt.ylabel('emus')`, `plt.title('Emus versus flamingos')`.  Note that if you have turned the axes off, your titles will not show up. You can verify this by commenting out the line `plt.axis('off')` and observing how it affects the output."

    "# Section 4: Image Convolution\n",
    "We will find that a key element of [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) is a **convolutional layer**.  It is thus critical that we understand the basics of **image convolution** and how to interpret those results. We will describe how convolution is used in CNNs in Tutorial 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical function used to extract information from images, and is useful in CNNs to identify various features of an image. The inputs to this function are our image and a **filter kernel**, which is a small matrix of coefficients, often 3x3 or 5x5. The filter kernel dimensions are almost always square, and have an odd number of pixels in each dimension, so that the filter kernel has a well-defined center pixel. The output of the convolution function is a matrix, often of a similar size as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common steps used to construct the output matrix are as follows, though note that we can vary many parameters of the convolution process to fit our needs. In order to calculate the output pixel at position (m,n), we align the center of the filter kernel with the pixel at position (m,n) in the input image. Then, we multiply the corresponding elements of the filter kernel with the input image element-wise, and add these values up to produce our desired output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutions on the edges of images\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is not inherently well-defined for the edges of images, and there are multiple different ways that users can handle the edge cases of convolution. One approach is to only create output pixels in positions where the filter kernel fully overlaps with the input image. This results in an output matrix that is smaller than the input matrix. For example, if our input image is 4x4 pixels large, and our filter kernel is 3x3 pixels large, then our output kernel would be 2x2 pixels. Another approach is to set every value outside of the matrix to a given value, such as zero. This ensures that the input and output matricies are the same size, but it introduces edge effects. For example, we may notice that the edges of the output matrix are darker than would be expected because they assuming that everything outside of the image is black. The approach used in the graphic shown below involves setting the pixel values outside of the image to that of the nearest pixel. This way, the pixel values are \"extended\" over the edge of the image, and the input image and ouptut image are the same size."
