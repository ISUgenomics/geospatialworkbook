    "#### What is a Neural Network\n",
    "A neural network is essentially a complicated mathematical function that receives inputs, such as images, and outputs predictions, such as image classification. A neural network has very many, often millions of parameters that control its functionality. You can think of each parameter as a dial, and the process of training a model involves iteratively adjusting the dials to improve the model's performance. Each iteration of the model training process involves passing data through the model, observing the model's accuracy, applying slight adjustments to the parameters to improve model performance, and repeating. If you are interested in learning more about the inner workings of neural networks, you can find more information [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). For this tutorial, we do not need an in depth understanding of the inner workings of a neural network, since we are not building and training a neural network from scratch. Raster Vision allows us to use a pre-defined model structure, which allows us to benefit from transfer learning.</br>"

    "#### What is Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a neural network from scratch requires a lot of time and computational resources because there are so many parameters in our model to tune. Transfer Learning is a very common approach used to decrease the time it takes to train a model. With transfer learning, we first find a model that has already been trained to perform a certain task. Then, we use that model as a starting point, and further train it to perform new task. For example, say we wish to build a model that can identify trucks in images. If we already have a model that is trained to identify cars in images, then we can use that model as the starting point of our training procedure, and further train our pre-trained model using a dataset of truck images. This will work a lot faster than building a new model from scratch. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the [ResNet50 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which is pre-trained on the [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/index.php). The ImageNet dataset contains over a million labeled images of objects in 1000 different classes, such as \"canoe\", \"isopod\", \"acorn\", and \"miniature schnauzer\". Since the ImageNet dataset contains a large breadth of image classes, the ResNet50 model can extract various image features and can thus be applied to diverse use cases."

    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Parameters</b> are the \"dials\" within the model that are adjusted to improve the training accuracy. Parameter values are not directly set or updated by the analyst. Rather, they are initialized and updated through the model training process. <b>Hyperparameters</b>, on the other hand, are variables that control the process of training. Hyperparameters are set manually by the analyst, and analysts will often try a variety of different hyperparameter values to see which yields the best model. </br></br>\n",
    "Examples of hyperparameters include:\n",
    "- <b>Number of epochs</b>: the number of times we pass the entire training set through the model during model training.\n",
    "- <b>Batch size</b>: the number of individual samples (ie labeled image chips) we pass through the model before updating the model parameters. Through the training process, we pass a batch of data through the model, observe the model performance, update the model parameters, and repeat. Once we have passed all of the training data through the dataset, we have completed one epoch.\n",
    "- <b>Learning rate</b>: a scaling factor for the magnitude of adjustments to parameters. If we have too small of a learning rate, we will take very small \"steps\", and training will be slow. If we have too large of a learning rate, we won't have very fine-tune control of our parameters and we may \"overstep\" the optimal parameter values."

    "#### Image Chipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neural network expects a specific input data size. For image datasets, this input data size refers to the pixel dimensions of the image, and the number of channels (most commonly, red, green, and blue). In geospatial data science, we often have very large images from satellite or drone imagery datasets. Neural networks generally operate on much smaller input sizes, so instead of passing an entire satellite image through a neural network, we break up our large imagery into smaller, bite-sized pieces of consistent dimensions called \"chips\". Chips can be sampled from an image dataset either in a grid-like fashion, or by random sampling. The chip size is another hyperparameter chosen by the analyst to fit the problem context, and various chip sizes can be tried. </br>\n",

    "#### Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different deep learning tasks we may wish to perform. Image Classification is the most basic deep learning task for image-based data. The goal of Image Classification is to input an image to a model and have the model output the image's class. For example, an Image Classification model could be trained to classify pictures as either \"cats\" or \"dogs\". Note that Image Classification models have a pre-defined set of classes to choose from, so if you have a model that can only choose between \"cats\" and \"dogs\", and you give that model a picture of a pig, the model will still return a prediction of either \"cats\" or \"dogs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For geospatial applications, we can build a model to classify chips of our dataset, instead of entire images. Hence, the Raster Vision documentation refers to this task as \"Chip Classification\" instead of \"Image Classification\" for clarity."

There is built-in support for chip classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation using PyTorch.\" [(rastervision.io)](https://rastervision.io/) </br>\n",
    "Raster Vision is a geospatial software tool produced by the company [Azavea](https://www.azavea.com/) that can be used as either a framework or as a library.

Advanced python programmers can use the Raster Vision library to use pieces of Raster Vision code in their own projects. We will focus solely on how to use the Raster Vision framework in this tutorial. </br></br>\n",
