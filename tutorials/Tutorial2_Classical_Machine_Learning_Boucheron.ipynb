    "## Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, we present a brief overview of classical machine learning concepts as applicable to image classification applications.  Completion of this tutorial should give participants the basic background and terminology necessary for an understanding of the basics of classical machine learning as applied to image classification.  In this tutorial, we will develop a classical machine learning algorithm capable of discriminating between objects present in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains 5 sections:\n",
    "  - **Section 0: Preliminaries**: some notes on using this notebook, how to download the image dataset that we will use for this tutorial, and import commands for the libraries necessary for this tutorial\n",
    "  - **Section 1: Working with the CalTech101 Dataest**: how to traverse and use the directory structure and files provided in the CalTech101 Dataset\n",
    "  - **Section 2: Feature Extraction**: examples of extraction of different feature categories from images, including color, region, and texture features\n",
    "    - **Section 2.1: Color Features**: statistics of the color within an image object\n",
    "    - **Section 2.2: Region Features**: measures of the size and shape of the image object\n",
    "    - **Section 2.3: Texture Features**: measures of the distribution of intensities within the image object\n",
    "  - **Section 3: Setting up a Feature Matrix and Label Vector**: aggregating features into a feature matrix in the format expected by machine learning algorithms along with definition of a label vector\n",

    "# Section 1: Working with the CalTech101 Dataset\n",
    "## Section 1.1: Exploring the Images\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we were working with only two images.  There are more than 8000 images in 101 different directories in the CalTech101 dataset.  We thus need to develop ways to efficiently loop over larger image datasets and access the images without hard coding the image filenames.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use the `glob` library to store directory names and filenames in a list.  You can store the directory names of the CalTech101 dataset in a list with `categories=sorted(glob.glob('101_ObjectCategories/*')`.  This list now gives you a means to loop over the 101 different categories of objects in that `categories[k]` is the `k`-th category name as a string (including the string `101_ObjectCategories/` prepended to the category name).  A few other notes:\n",
    "  - `glob.glob` returns an unordered list.  We wrap a `sorted` around the `glob.glob` command to return the directories or filenames in the usual alphabetical order\n",
    "  - `glob.glob` returns a list with the full pathname (from where you searched) prepended.  In this case, since we search from the directory just under `101_ObjectCategories/`, the string `101_ObjectCategories/` will be prepended to each of the 101 object categories.  If we had searched using a more complete path, e.g., `categories=sorted(glob.glob('/home/user/tutorials/101_ObjectCategories/*')`, the full specified path would be prepended to each of the categories.  The full pathname is very helpful if you need to access something within that path since you don't need to manually preprend the full path.\n",
    "  - `os.path.basename` will strip off only the base directory or filename from the full path if you don't want the full path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this list `categories`, we can read in the first image (`image_0001.jpg`) from each of the 101 categories and display that image in one location of an $11\\times10$ subplot.  We can also title each of those locations of the subplot with the category name.  We note that this code is not robust in the sense that we are relying on the existence of a specific filename format under each of the directories in `101_ObjectCategories`.  We will work with more robust means to traverse the files that exist in each directory in later portions of this tutorial."

    "### Section 1.2.1 Plotting the annotations as a boundary over the image\n",
    "The annotations are stored in Matlab's `.mat` format, which the `scipy.io` library in python can load.  Above, we have imported `scipy.io` as `spio`.  The image annotations can be read in with the `spio.loadmat` function, e.g., `ann=spio.loadmat('filename.mat')`.  The `spio.loadmat` function returns a dictionary with variable names as keys.  In the CalTech101 annotations, dictionary entry `ann['box_coord']` is a $1\\times4$ vector of bounding box coordinates and `ann['obj_contour']` is a $2\\times K$ vector of pixel locations which outline the contour of the object, where $K$ will be different for different annotations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we read in `Annotations/emu/annotation_0001.mat` and display `box_coord` and `obj_contour`.  The object contour points `obj_contour` are (for reasons unbeknownst to us) offset by the upper left `box_coord` coordinates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a further example, we read in the corresponding image `101_ObjectCategories/emu/image_0001.jpg` and display it.  On top of that image, we plot the annotation outline with a basic plot command `plt.plot(ann['obj_contour'][0,:]+ann['box_coord'][0,2]-1,ann['obj_contour'][1,:]+ann['box_coord'][0,0]-1,'w')`.  A few notes:\n",
    "  - We offset the contour points by the upper left corner of the bounding box.\n",
    "  - We need to offset all the points by -1 due to the difference in indexing in Matlab (starting at 1) and python (starting at 0).  Since the annotations were output in Matlab, the indexing is consistent with Matlab convention.\n",
    "  - We note that the annotations appear to be provided in standard Euclidean coordinates, i.e., assuming an x-axis (column), y-axis (row) ordering.\n",
    "  - We note that since we first displayed the image using `plt.imshow`, the axes for the figure are assumed to have the origin in the top left.  The `plt.plot` command will use the plotting coordinate conventions of x-axis, y-axis, but will follow the origin set up by the image visualization.\n",
    "  - All of the aforementioned observations were noted based on exploration of visualization of the annotations and hard-learned lessons regarding conventions in coordinate systems for images and image metadata.  Some insights were additionally gathered from the `show_annotation.m` file from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/show_annotation.m (the link appears to be currently broken, however)."

This feature matrix will be  $N\\times M$ where $N$ is the total number of images that we use as input and $M$ is the total number of features that we extract from each of the $N$ images. If we use all features from above we have a total of 97 features for each image (97 = 15 RGB features + 15 HSV features + 19 region features + 48 texture features).  This feature matrix is used as input to the classification algorithm to describe the image objects.\n",

    "The classification algorithm, however, also needs to be told what the label of each image is so that it can learn to discriminate the different objects.  The label vector will be an $N\\times 1$ vector.  Note that the number of rows $N$ in the feature matrix must correspond to the length $N$ of the label vector and there must be a one-to-one correspondence, i.e., the first row of the feature matrix must correspond to the first element in the label vector.  This label vector provides the identity (label) of each image.  There are different means to define labels for machine learning algorithms.  This example will be specific to the `sklearn` package in python, but will be similar in flavor to necessary format for other frameworks.  We will learn a different formulation of the label vector for deep learning in Tutorial 3."

    "In this part, we use what we learned from Section 1 above about looping over the directory structure of the CalTech101 dataset.  We will loop over multiple images, extract features, and build a feature matrix and label vector.  We write this code so that the user can specify the categories of interest as a list of strings.  Those strings are used to navigate into the directories of images from which to extract features.  Feature vectors `f_rgb`, `f_hsv`, `f_region`,  and `f_texture` are extracted from each image and stacked in an $N\\times97$ feature matrix, where $N$ is the total number of images, and 97 is the feature vector dimensionality.  At the same time, we create a corresponding $N\\times1$ label vector (actually a list in python).  \n",
    "\n",
    "While we loop over all images in the specified categories, we split the data into a training set consisting of 90% of the data and a test set consisting of the remaining 10%.  We call the two feature matrices `X_train` and `X_test` and the  two label vectors, `y_train` and `y_test`, consistent with common notation in machine learning.  In this case, the label vectors `y_train` and `y_test` are actually lists of the class strings (e.g., `'emu'`).  \n",
