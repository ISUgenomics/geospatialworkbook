    "This document includes instructions for setting up interactive jupyter notebook-based tutorials on Ceres or Atlas. This is intended for users with SCINet accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, launch Open OnDemand either for [Atlas](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) or for [Ceres](https://ceres-ondemand-dev.scinet.usda.gov/pun/sys/dashboard). Most tutorials can be run on either cluster with the exception of tutorials that require GPU usage, which must be run on Atlas. Log in with your SCINet credentials. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Group Identification\n",
    "Users must specify a project account name to launch a jupyter session, and if needed, to run batch scripts through slurm. If you are a part of a project group, then you can use that group name as your account name to run scripts. </br> </br>\n",
    "From the OnDemand main page, click <b>Clusters</b>, then <b>Atlas Shell Access</b> or <b>Ceres Shell Access </b>. </br>\n",
    "![cluster_tab](imgs/atlas_shell_access.png) </br>\n",
    "This will open up a terminal tab in another browser window. Log in with your SCINet credentials, then run the following command: </br>\n",
    "`sacctmgr -Pns show user format=account where user=$USER` </br> </br>\n",
    "This will output a list of project groups you are a part of. If you are a part of a project group, you can use any of these project group names to launch jobs for this tutorial. </br> </br>\n",
    "If you are <b>not</b> a part of a project group, you can use the account `sandbox`. This will only grant you access to limited computational resources, and the scripts included in this tutorial will take longer to run. Take note of the project group name you would like to use, as we will need it in the next step. </br></br>\n",
    "Next, decide on the location where you would like to run your tutorial. This could be in your home directory, a `/project` directory, or in `/90daydata`. Take note of the path to the directory directory where you would like to store your tutorial materials, as we will need this in the next step. In the following steps, we will create a folder in this directory with resources specific to your chosen tutorial. If you wish to complete multiple tutorials, you may choose to create a directory called, for example, `workbook_tutorials` to store multiple tutorial folders.\n",

    "Navigate to the directory you would like to store your project directory in, and run the following commands. This will create your project directory, store the project directory path into the shell variable `project_dir`, and to store your project group name into the shell variable `project_name`.
