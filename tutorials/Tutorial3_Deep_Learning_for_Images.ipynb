    "## Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the basic structure and common components (convolutional layers, pooling layers, nonlinearities, fully connected layers, etc.) of deep learning networks through a combination of illustrations and hands-on implementation of a network.  By the end of this tutorial, we will have built from scratch a deep convolutional neural network to operate on the standard MNIST handwritten digits dataset.  We will then explore some ways of probing the characteristics of the trained network to help us debug common pitfalls in adapting network architectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains 7 sections:\n",
    "  - **Section 0: Preliminaries**: some notes on using this notebook, how to download the image dataset that we will use for this tutorial, and import commands for the libraries necessary for this tutorial\n",
    "  - **Section 1: The MNIST Dataset** how to load the MNIST dataset and some ideas for visualization of the dataset\n",
    "  - **Section 2: Data Preprocessing (Dimensionality Wrangling)** how to preprocess the MNIST dataset in preparation for using it to train a deep network, including dimensionality and intensity scaling of the images and coding of the labels\n",
    "  - **Section 3: Building a CNN for MNIST** how to build a basic 2-layer CNN for classification of MNIST digits including definition of the network architecture, compilation, and training\n",
    "  - Detour to a powerpoint presentation to learn more about the different CNN layers which are currently training\n",
    "  - **Section 4: Testing the Trained CNN** how to test the accuracy of the trained network and locate those images incorrectly classified\n",
    "  - **Section 5: Transfer Learning for MNIST** how to adapt a previously trained network to a new dataset\n",
    "  - **Section 6: Saving a Trained Model** how to save a trained model so that you can load it and use it later.\n",

    "There are two main types of cells in this notebook: code and markdown (text).  You can add a new cell with the plus sign in the menu bar above and you can change the type of cell with the dropdown menu in the menu bar above.  As you complete this tutorial, you may wish to add additional code cells to try out your own code and markdown cells to add your own comments or notes. \n",

    "Once you have completed (all or part) of this notebook, you can share your results with colleagues by sending them the `.ipynb` file.  Your colleagues can then open the file and will see your markdown and code cells as well as any results that were printed or displayed at the time you saved the notebook.  If you prefer to send a notebook without results displayed (like this notebook appeared when you downloaded it), you can select (\"Restart & Clear Output\") from the Kernel menu above.  You can also export this notebook in a non-executable form, e.g., `.pdf` through the File, Save As menu."

Back in the world of classical machine learning, this avoids a specific feature dominating the classification simply because it is larger.  In deep learning, continuing this convention allows for more consistency and robustness in the computation of the various gradients during training.  The risk of overflow (exceeding the capabilities of a variable type to represent a very large number) or underflow (exceeding the capabilities of a variable type to represent a very small, i.e., close to zero, number) is very real in deep learning."

In a typical application, the last layer is a `softmax` layer which outputs *probabilities of a sample belonging to each of the classes* $C_j,~j=0,\\ldots,N_\\text{classes}-1$.  Thus, the `softmax` layer for an MNIST digit classification will have form $$[p(C_0),p(C_1),p(C_2),p(C_3),p(C_4),p(C_5),p(C_6),p(C_7),p(C_8),p(C_9)]^T.$$  A simple argmax predicts the label as the class with the highest probability, i.e., $\\hat{y}=\\text{argmax}_j p(C_j)$.

The performance we will see below on the ability to correctly classify all images of the numeral 3 would be identical.
