    "Apptainer used to be called Singularity, and the name changed when the Singularity project [moved to the Linux Foundation](https://apptainer.org/news/community-announcement-20211130/) in 2021. The two softwares work the same, just with different terminology. For example, you now use the `apptainer` command in place of the `singularity` command. You see in this tutorial a few instances in which the \"singularity\" terminology still persists, even when interacting with the Apptainer module. For example, Apptainer/Singularity image files, even those built with Apptainer, still have the extension \".sif\", which stands for Singularity Image File."

    "### 1. Containerization Background and Setup\n",
    "One of the most difficult aspects of software development is setting up the computing environment - ensuring you are running your code with all the right software configurations set and dependency versions installed. You may build an application on your machine, but struggle to get it to work the same way on a different machine because of differing software installations and configurations. Containerization is used to prevent dependency issues and improve the portability of code. Containers are collections of code along with all the needed dependencies. They can be easily moved from one machine to another, and perform identically regardless of where they are running, and users don't need to install all of the dependencies and ensure they are all the right versions - they just need the image. <br>\n",

    "The developers of Raster Vision publish the Raster Vision software as Docker images to simplify the process of running the Raster Vision pipeline. New versions of Raster Vision are released as Docker images [here](https://quay.io/repository/azavea/raster-vision?tab=tags). Docker and Apptainer are two different containerization platforms, each with their own pros and cons. Docker is a popular containerization tool, however it requires root access to run and therefore can't be used on an HPC like Atlas. Apptainer (formerly Singularity), on the other hand, is designed to not require root access so it can be used on an HPC system. Thankfully, we can create an Apptainer image out of a Docker image, so we can run the Raster Vision code on Atlas. In the following instructions, we will use build an Apptainer image out of the Raster Vision Docker image. <br><br>\n",

    "### 2. Apptainer File Systems\n",
    "In addition to providing an isolated computing environment, apptainer containers also have their own file systems separate from the host system's file system. Directories in the host system are made available within the container's file system by _binding_ directories. For example, say you have a directory of data files on the host file system at `/project/example/data` that you would like to have access to within the container. You could make this directory available within the container by binding the directory `/project/example/data` to a directory in the container's file system, such as `/opt/data`. Then, when you start the container, you can navigate to `/opt/data` within the container and access the files in `/project/example/data` on the host system. If you modify files in the container in `/opt/data`, then these changes will also affect the host system at `/project/example/data`. This way, we can save files to the host system from within the container to access later. Note that the permissions you have on the host system will be identical to the permissions you have within the container, so you can't perform any actions to the host's file system within a container that you couldn't otherwise do outside of the container.<br><br>\n",
    "Depending on the administrative configurations of the host system, certain directories in the host's file system are bound to directories in the container's file system by default. For example, it is common for the directory `$HOME` in the host's file system to be bound to the directory `/home` within the container, and for the working directory on the host system to be bound to a directory with the same name in the container. If you wish to bind additional directories, you can specify the directories you'd like to bind when you launch the container. We will discuss the specifics of how to bind directories later in section 4 of this tutorial after we discuss how to launch a container."
