    "Raster Vision provides a plethora of classes used for various aspects of model configuration. Raster Vision relies heavily on Abstract Base Classes (ABC's) and pydantic models. If you are not familiar with ABC's in python, you can learn more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABC), and if you are not familiar with pydantic models, you can find a brief introduction [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and a thorough description of how to use them [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest hurdles to understanding Raster Vision code is understanding all of the different classes that Raster Vision defines. Many classes in Raster Vision are subclasses of other classes in Raster Vision, or have other class objects as attributes. This can make the documentation confusing for a newcomer, as further research into one class will only yield several more unfamiliar classes. Here, we provide an overview of what classes and functions are used to configure a basic model.\n",

    "### 1. Config Objects and the get_config() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster Vision users configure a model pipeline by writing a python script that defines a function called `get_config()`. This function builds and returns an instance of [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html). The class [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) is an Abstract Base Class (ABC), and users must build an instance of one of [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html)'s three concrete subclasses: \n",
    "- [`ChipClassificationConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.chip_classification_config.ChipClassificationConfig.html#chipclassificationconfig)\n",
    "- [`ObjectDetectionConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.object_detection_config.ObjectDetectionConfig.html)\n",

    "The [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object encapsulates all the information that the Raster Vision pipeline needs to build the model, including what deep learning task to perform, where the data is stored, what model architecture to build, and various hyperparameter values. The Raster Vision pipeline calls the `get_config()` function defined by the user to produce a [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object, uses that [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object as a blueprint for how to build the desired model, and follows the steps of the pipeline as described in tutorial 2."

    "When reading through the Raster Vision documentation and code, you will see many classes defined by Raster Vision with names that end with [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html), such as [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html), [`ClassConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.data.class_config.ClassConfig.html), and [`DatasetConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/search.html?q=datasetconfig&check_keywords=yes&area=default). All of these objects are subclasses of Raster Visions [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html) class, which is itself a pydantic model. Config objects are created to take advantage of pydantic's validation features, so behind the scenes, Raster Vision can validate the user's input to ensure that all of the parameters are valid. Many [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html) objects have associated objects - for example, [`DatasetConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/search.html?q=datasetconfig&check_keywords=yes&area=default) objects are blueprints for pytorch [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) objects and [`SemanticSegmentationConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation_config.SemanticSegmentationConfig.html) objects are blueprints for [`SemanticSegmentation`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.21/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation.SemanticSegmentation.html#rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation.SemanticSegmentation) objects. This allows Raster Vision to validate the user's input before creating and using an object.</br></br>"

    "The `model/` directory is where we will run the Raster Vision pipeline - this is where our code is, and where our output data will go. Here we describe the contents of this folder more thoroughly: \n",
    "- The `model/src` directory contains python scripts that define different versions of the `get_config()` function. The first script, `tiny_spacenet1.py`, is practically identical to the quickstart code produced by the Raster Vision team. Each subsequent script incorporates tweaks and updates to modify the model and improve model performance.\n",
    "- The file `model/run_model.sh` is a shell script we use to execute the pipeline through SLURM. This script builds the singularity image with the needed path bindings, invokes the raster vision pipeline, and refers to the desired python script in `model/src`.\n",
    "- The `model/local` directory is included to provide scratch space for singularity. We don't need to put any files in this directory, but singularity will use it when we build our container, and will throw errors if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we run the pipeline in this tutorial series, we specify the name of an output directory to store all of our output files in. The pipeline will create this folder in `model/` if it does not yet exist. The pipeline config will populate the output directory with many files and subdirectories, only a few of which we will need to reference in this tutorial. These include the `eval/` directory, which contains our evaluation metrics, the `predict/` directory which contains predictions on the validation set, the `train/` directory which contains our tensorboard logs, and the `bundle/` directory which contains a bundle of the model for deployment."
