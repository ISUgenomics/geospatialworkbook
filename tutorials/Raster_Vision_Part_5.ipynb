    "Raster Vision provides a plethora of classes used for various aspects of model configuration. Raster Vision relies heavily on Abstract Base Classes (ABC's) and pydantic models. If you are not familiar with ABC's in python, you can learn more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABC), and if you are not familiar with pydantic models, you can find a brief introduction [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and a thorough description of how to use them [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest hurdles to understanding Raster Vision code is understanding all of the different classes that Raster Vision defines. Many classes in Raster Vision are subclasses of other classes in Raster Vision, or have other class objects as attributes. This can make the documentation confusing for a newcomer, as further research into one class will only yield several more unfamiliar classes. Here, we provide an overview of what classes and functions are used to configure a basic model.\n",

    "### 1. Config Objects and the get_config() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster Vision users configure a model pipeline by writing a python script that defines a function called `get_config()`. This function builds and returns an instance of [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html). The class [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) is an Abstract Base Class (ABC), and users must build an instance of one of [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html)'s three concrete subclasses: \n",
    "- [`ChipClassificationConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.chip_classification_config.ChipClassificationConfig.html#chipclassificationconfig)\n",
    "- [`ObjectDetectionConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.object_detection_config.ObjectDetectionConfig.html)\n",

    "The [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object encapsulates all the information that the Raster Vision pipeline needs to build the model, including what deep learning task to perform, where the data is stored, what model architecture to build, and various hyperparameter values. The Raster Vision pipeline calls the `get_config()` function defined by the user to produce a [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object, uses that [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html) object as a blueprint for how to build the desired model, and follows the steps of the pipeline as described in tutorial 2."

    "When reading through the Raster Vision documentation and code, you will see many classes defined by Raster Vision with names that end with [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html), such as [`RVPipelineConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.rv_pipeline_config.RVPipelineConfig.html), [`ClassConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.data.class_config.ClassConfig.html), and [`DatasetConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.data.dataset_config.DatasetConfig.html). All of these objects are subclasses of Raster Visions [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html) class, which is itself a pydantic model. Config objects are created to take advantage of pydantic's validation features, so behind the scenes, Raster Vision can validate the user's input to ensure that all of the parameters are valid. Many [`Config`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.pipeline.config.Config.html) objects have associated objects - for example, [`DatasetConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.data.dataset_config.DatasetConfig.html) objects are blueprints for pytorch [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) objects and [`SemanticSegmentationConfig`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation_config.SemanticSegmentationConfig.html) objects are blueprints for [`SemanticSegmentation`](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.30/api_reference/_generated/rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation.SemanticSegmentation.html#rastervision.core.rv_pipeline.semantic_segmentation.SemanticSegmentation) objects. This allows Raster Vision to validate the user's input before creating and using an object.<br><br>"

These include the `eval/` directory, which will contain our evaluation metrics, the `predict/` directory which will contain prediction rasters associated with the validation and test sets, the `train/` directory which contains metrics collected during the training process, and the `bundle/` directory which contains a bundle of the model for deployment."
