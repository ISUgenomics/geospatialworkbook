    "This tutorial contains 5 sections:\n",
    "  - **Section 0: Preliminaries**: some notes on using this notebook, how to download the image dataset that we will use for this tutorial, and import commands for the libraries necessary for this tutorial\n",
    "  - **Section 1: Printing Characteristics of the CNN** how to print textual summaries of the CNN architecture\n",
    "  - **Section 2: Visualizing Activations** how to filter an example image through thhe MNIST network and visualize the activations\n",
    "  - **Section 3: Inputting New and Different Data to the Network** how to process new data to be compatible with the MNIST network and the effects of showing a non-digit image to the network\n",
    "  - **Section 4: The VGG Network** an exploration of the VGG16 network.\n",
    "  \n",

    "## A Note on Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of cells in this notebook: code and markdown (text).  You can add a new cell with the plus sign in the menu bar above and you can change the type of cell with the dropdown menu in the menu bar above.  As you complete this tutorial, you may wish to add additional code cells to try out your own code and markdown cells to add your own comments or notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells can be augmented with a number of text formatting features, including\n",
    "  - bulleted\n",
    "  - lists\n",
    "\n",
    "embedded $\\LaTeX$, monotype specification of `code syntax`, **bold font**, and *italic font*.  There are many other features of markdown cells--see the jupyter documentation for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit a cell by double clicking on it.  If you double click on this cell, you can see how to implement the various formatting referenced above.  Code cells can be run and markdown cells can be formatted using Shift+Enter or by selecting the Run button in the toolbar above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed (all or part) of this notebook, you can share your results with colleagues by sending them the `.ipynb` file.  Your colleagues can then open the file and will see your markdown and code cells as well as any results that were printed or displayed at the time you saved the notebook.  If you prefer to send a notebook without results displayed (like this notebook appeared when you downloaded it), you can select (\"Restart & Clear Output\") from the Kernel menu above.  You can also export this notebook in a non-executable form, e.g., `.pdf` through the File, Save As menu."

    " - You may get one or more warnings complaining about various configs.  As long as you don't get any errors, you should be good to go.  You can, if you wish, fix whatever is causing a warning at a later point in time.  I find it best to copy and paste the error warning itself into a Google search and tack on the OS in which you encountered the error.  Seldom have I encountered an error that someone else hasn't encountered in my same OS.\n",
    " - The third to the last line in the following code cell imports the MNIST dataset.\n",
    " - The last two lines load the VGG16 network and the weights for that network trained on the ImageNet dataset.  The code below will load the VGG16 network, trained on ImageNet.  The first time this code is run, the trained network will be downloaded.  Subsequent times, the trained network will be loaded from the local disk.  This network is very large (528 MB) as we will see shortly, so it may take some time to download.  Generally, we would include the last line below as part of our code rather than imports, but we include it here to allow that download to complete before the workshop."
