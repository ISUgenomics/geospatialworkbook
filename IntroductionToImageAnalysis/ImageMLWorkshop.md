# Workshop 1

## Day 1

Download the Jupyter Notebook and image data

**If working on a laptop** (right click the links to download)

[Tutorial1_Image_Processing_Essentials.ipynb](https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/tutorials/Tutorial1_Image_Processing_Essentials.ipynb)

[cameraman.png](https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/data_images/cameraman.png)

[peppers.png](https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/data_images/peppers.png)

save these items in your working directory

**If working on the ARS Ceres HPC**

navigate to your working directory, then:

```
curl -O https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/tutorials/Tutorial1_Image_Processing_Essentials.ipynb -O https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/data_images/cameraman.png -O https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/data_images/peppers.png
```

## Day 2

Download the Jupyter Notebook and image data

**If working on a laptop**

[Tutorial2_Classical_Machine_Learning.ipynb](https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/tutorials/Tutorial2_Classical_Machine_Learning.ipynb) (right click the link to download)

[CalTech101 dataset 101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz) (126 MB; follow the link to download)

[CalTech101 dataset Annotations.tar](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/Annotations.tar) (13 MB; follow the link to download)

Move the compressed image data folders to your working directory and unzip. Unzip using a terminal (e.g. Windows PowerShell) with ```tar -xvf filename```

**If working on the ARS Ceres HPC**

navigate to your working directory, then:

```
curl -O https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/tutorials/Tutorial2_Classical_Machine_Learning.ipynb
cp /project/shared_files/NMSU-AI-WORKSHOP/*.zip ./
unzip '*.zip'
```

Note: If you are following this tutorial after the workshop has ended and the NMSU-AI-WORKSHOP shared folder no longer exists, do the following:
- Download and untar the image data to your local machine with the laptop instructions above
- Zip both folders of data (on Windows: right click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder)
- Login to Ceres with JupyterHub and upload the zip files (the larger zip will take a few minutes). The upload button is on the JupyterLab navigation pane between the New Folder icon and the Refresh File List icon
- Move the files to your working directory on Ceres and ```unzip `*.zip'```

## Day 3

Download the Jupyter Notebook.

Also make sure you have built the workshop Conda environment and then activate it (use the kernel) inside your Jupyter Notebook ([use the instructions on the setup page](https://kerriegeil.github.io/NMSU-USDA-ARS-AI-Workshops/setup/)). You will not be able to run the Notebook for Day 3 if you haven't built and activated the workshop Conda environment successfully.
